                    <p>For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to understand how software is made and held together. Having used a computer from a young age, I've always found myself able to quickly learn new software, and how to use it well. Even now, I have a great amount of care for software, as well as preserving it.</p>
                    <p>As for hobbies, I really enjoy drawing and typography. In the future, I'd love to find ways to implement these hobbies into my work.</p>
